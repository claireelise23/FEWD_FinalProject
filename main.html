  <section class="section_3">
    <p class="Content">This family-owned farm and business began as a part-time operation in the mid-1990s producing baby lettuce for local retailers. In 1999, the farm became a full-time operation. Since then, the farm has grown into a thriving year-round operation composed of 160 acres, with nearly an acre of indoor production space.</p>
    <p class="Content">Our focus both then and now is to provide the highest quality plants and produce coupled with exceptional customer service for our valued customers in an environmentally friendly and sustainable manner. In addition to being excellent stewards of our land, we strive to support our community as well. These activities include regular produce donations to local food banks, and employing recently resettled refugees from all over the world through partnerships with local agencies.</p>
